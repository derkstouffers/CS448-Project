DungeonSmith: Senior Project FALL24

  DungeonSmith is a level building application where you can build to your hearts desire and then play through the exciting world you created! 
  It is similar to some existing applications, such as Mario Maker, but as it is not tied to an existing brand, we are able to add whatever we want. 
  This gives us a lot more flexibility in the features, characters, and blocks that we add. DungeonSmith can be used to teach kids about game development and get them interested in STEM, or just for fun!

  Our goal is for this to be used by kids age 6 and up, so they can have a simple, fun, and interactive introduction to game design.

  To run properly, make sure you are in the load_screen node, before pressing run or f6
